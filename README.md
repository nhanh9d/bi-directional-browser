# BiDirectionalBrowser

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.2.8 and was created to make a demo follow by [this post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/linusekenstam_this-is-unacceptable-should-not-be-possible-activity-7133130976951480321-oNbn?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Playground

Open 2 browers side by side and add parameter:
- `http://localhost:4200/?id=1`
- `http://localhost:4200/?id=2`
Try to move around the right one (as the demo is available to do so)
